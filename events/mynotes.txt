# To create a model (from project root dir)

# models are single name, tables plural
# coluns:type
# we dont have to add id in here, rails will take care of that

rails g model event name:string location:string price:decimal

# that has created file under db/migrate/ : genericruby code that can interact with different db and create tables
# to actually create the table we have to run the migration with rake

rake -T # show all the tasks

rake db:migrate # ceate events db table

rake db:migrate:status # show the status of the db migrate

# we can use rails console to fill db while model is there and no interface yet !

rails c

# to create and object event e 

e = Event.new

# to fill e 

e.name = "BugSmash"
...

# to save e 

e.save

# or 

e = Event.new(name: "Hackathon", location: "Austin, TX", price: 15.00)
e.save

# or directly save

e = Event.create(name: "Kata Camp", location: "Dallas, TX", price: 75.00)

# to find event with id = 3

e = Event.find(3)

e = Event.find_by(name: "Kata Camp")

e.price.to_s # will return "75.00"
